# Data Structures - ArrayLists and Arrays

_**This is a Makers Bite.** Bites are designed to train specific skills or

example solution video, and a challenge without a solution video for you to test

In this bite, you will learn how to store multiple data items within a single 
variable in Java, by using array-based data structures.

## Introduction

There are lots of different data structures in Java, but they're not all going 
to be useful in the immediate future. Here, you'll learn about creating lists
in Java.

> For this section, create a class called `Sandbox` so that you can write some 
> experimental code in the `main` method. You'll need to `import` ArrayList too,
> so your code will start by looking something like this:
> ```java
> import java.util.ArrayList;
> 
> public class Sandbox {
>     [...]
> }
> ```

## `ArrayList`s

Java stores its list data in an object called an ArrayList. Let's see some 
examples:

```java
ArrayList<String> contentsOfMyPocket = new ArrayList<String>();
contentsOfMyPocket.add("keys");
contentsOfMyPocket.add("phone");
contentsOfMyPocket.add("fluff");

ArrayList<Integer> reallyGreatNumbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();
reallyGreatNumbers.add(3);
reallyGreatNumbers.add(5);
reallyGreatNumbers.add(7);
reallyGreatNumbers.add(11);
```

Notice how, in each case, we have to declare what type of thing the ArrayList
will contain. You might be wondering what would happen if you tried to add an 
Integer to `contentsOfMyPocket`. What would you expect to happen? (Give it a 
try in the `main` method of your `Sandbox` class.)

Now let's see how to read, change and remove ArrayList items.

```java
// first, create the ArrayList and add some Integers
ArrayList<Integer> reallyGreatNumbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();
reallyGreatNumbers.add(3);
reallyGreatNumbers.add(5);
reallyGreatNumbers.add(7);
reallyGreatNumbers.add(11);
// you can read / get an item using its list index
reallyGreatNumbers.get(0);
// => 3
reallyGreatNumbers.get(1);
// => 5

// you can change an item using its list index and the new value
reallyGreatNumbers.set(0, 11);
// would change the first item to 11

// you can remove an item using its list index
reallyGreatNumbers.remove(0);
// would remove the first item
```

So there are four methods to remember here:

* `add` to add items
* `remove` to remove items
* `get` to read / get items
* `set` to change / set items

Finally, it's useful to know how to iterate through an ArrayList. There are a 
few options, but for now we'll go with one of the simplest iterators to 
understand (it'll look very familiar to you if you've worked with Python). 

If you already have an ArrayList of `contentsOfMyPocket`, you could do this:

```java
for (String item : contentsOfMyPocket) {
  System.out.println(item);
}
```

Note the typing crops up again! Within the for loop, we use the variable `item`
to hold each item as we iterate through the ArrayList. When declaring `item` we
have to state what type of thing it will hold - in this case, by typing `String
item`.

## Arrays

Java Arrays are a lot like `ArrayList`s but there is a crucial difference - 
Arrays are of a fixed length. So, when you create a new empty Array, you need 
to state how many things it needs to hold. For example:

```java
String[] plantsIHaveKilled = new String[100];
```

The `String[100]` bit means that we want an empty array that will eventually 
hold Strings and that it should have 100 empty slots. If you end up killing 
more than 100 plants, you'll need to create a new Array with larger capacity 
and copy everything over.

> Dev: Thanks, Java, you're a bit fussy but I kind of like you.

One nice thing about arrays is that you can create and manipulate them in a 
more concise manner.

```java
// create an array of four Strings
String[] famousCats = {"Larry", "Palmerston", "Geronimo", "Cat Stevens"};

// get the first item
famousCats[0];
// => "Larry"

// change the first item
famousCats[0] = "Grumpy Cat";

// remove the first item by replacing it will `null`
famousCats[0] = null;
```

> You'll see both Arrays and `ArrayList`s used in the wild. At some point, 
you'll probably make the wrong choice - it happens to us all - then you'll get 
feedback and learn from the mistake :)

## Exercise

Define a class called `ReadingList` that has an instance field called `unread` 
that holds an Array of Strings. Also, define a method called `add` which takes 
one argument (a book title) and adds it to the first empty slot in your 
`unread` Array. NOTE: We're using Arrays here, not `ArrayList`s. This will 
make the task of adding items a bit more complex!

## Challenge

Define a class called `Queue` which has an instance field called `people` that 
holds an ArrayList of Strings. Each item in the `people` ArrayList will be the 
name of a person in a queue. The class should have three methods.

* `add` - which adds people to the end of the `people` ArrayList
* `next` - which gets and removes the first person in the `people` ArrayList
* `state` - which prints a list of all the `people` who are currently queuing
