# Spring Boot

_**This is a Makers Bite.** Bites are designed to train specific skills or
tools. They contain an intro, a demonstration video, some exercises with an
example solution video, and a challenge without a solution video for you to test
your learning. [Read more about how to use Makers

In this bite, you'll learn to build simple web applications in Java by using 
the Spring Boot framework.

## Introduction

Spring is tool used to build web-applications in Java. It's like Sinatra (in 
Ruby) or Flask (in Python), but with a ton of extra features that will appear 
a bit magical at first - perhaps to your confusion and / or annoyance!

Spring **Boot** is a specific Spring setup that is slightly easier for newcomers 
to use.

It's a huge and complex tool which can be used to build all manner of web 
applications. Here, we'll focus on building something relatively simple :)

### Spring Initializr

Those helpful folks at Spring have created an online tool to help you get set 
up with Spring Boot - it's called Spring Initializr. You can use it to configure 
an initial Spring Boot application and download a starter codebase.

[Here's one I configured earlier](https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&language=java&platformVersion=3.0.12&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=17&groupId=com.example&artifactId=hello-world&name=hello-world&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.hello-world&dependencies=web). 
If you click on `GENERATE`, you'll download the starter codebase as a zip file 
which you can then unzip and open in IntelliJ.

Once you've done that, you can start the application using the 'play' button in 
IntelliJ. If that doesn't work for some reason, find the Gradle tab on the far
left or far right of IntelliJ's window (or access it from the menu `View` ->
`Tool Windows` -> `gradle`) and go to `tasks` -> `application` then double click
`bootRun`.

IntelliJ will chuck a ton of text into the integrated terminal and then finally 
tell you that the application is running on port 8080 - go to `localhost:8080` 
in your browser and you'll see a Spring Boot error message! Congratulations, 
you're ready to go.

### Adding a Controller

At the moment, your little app doesn't know how to handle the `GET "/"` 
request which is generated when you go to `localhost:8080` so let's fix that.

You'll need a controller so that this request can me _mapped_ onto some code. 
Create a new Java class called `HelloWorldController` in the same directory 
as `HelloWorldApplication`. Then paste in the code below. You'll notice a few 
new things, which I'll explain shortly.

```java
package com.example.helloworld;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloWorldController {

  @GetMapping("/")
  public String index() {
    return "Greetings from Spring Boot!";
  }

}
```

#### Imports

For your controller, you needed to import some tools that are defined in the 
Spring Web dependency - `GetMapping` and `RestController`.

#### Annotations

The expressions that start with `@` are called annotations. They are used to 
label chunks of code either for the compiler, for a tool that you're using 
(in this case, Spring Boot) or so that something specific happens at runtime 
(when your code is executed).

* `@RestController` tells Spring Boot that the following class is a controller 
for a web application.
* `@GetMapping` tells Spring Boot that this code should be used to handle a 
specific `GET` request.

You'll see lots of other annotations in Java, both in Spring Boot and elsewhere. 
For example, as you saw in the Test Driven Development bite, the JUnit testing 
framework using `@Test` to annotate tests so that they can be found and run 
when the test suite is executed.

> If you want to experiment with these annotations, see what happens when you 
> change `@GetMapping("/")` to `@GetMapping("/hello")`.

### Adding Templates

We're going to use a templating engine called Thymeleaf. To set things up, 
we'll need to:

1. Add the Thymeleaf dependency to `build.gradle`
2. Configure Spring Boot to use Thymeleaf

#### Adding the Dependency

Find `build.gradle` and add a new line in the `dependencies` block - you don't 
need to comma separate lines there, so don't add any commas. Start to add the 
dependency, as shown below, (no copy-pasting!) and you'll probably find that 
IntelliJ provides some helpful suggestions as you type.

```groovy
	implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf:3.0.5'
```

This helpful behaviour of IntelliJ will come in handy if you're looking for 
guidance on how to install a dependency but can only find the instructions 
to Maven, not Gradle.

[Show me the Maven syntax for Thymeleaf, I'm curious!](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-start#simple-mvc-view)

#### Configuring Spring Boot

Web frameworks tend to have a set of configuration files that are separate 
from the business logic, and Spring Boot is no different. You can also use 
multiple configuration files to, for example, specify different configurations 
for different environments.

Here we're going to use one configuration file and it's called 
`application.properties` - find it in `src` -> `main` -> `resources` then add 
the following (without the comments).

```java
spring.thymeleaf.cache=false
// tell Spring Boot to use Thymeleaf
spring.thymeleaf.enabled=true
// tell Spring Boot where to find Thymeleaf templates
spring.thymeleaf.prefix=classpath:/templates/
// tell Spring Boot what file extension your templates will have
spring.thymeleaf.suffix=.html
```

### Adding a Template

Now we're ready to add a template. Create a new HTML file in `src` -> `main` ->
`resources` -> `templates` called `home` - if you specifically choose to add a
new HTML file, you won't need to include the `.html` extension as IntelliJ will
do that for you.

Add any HTML you like to your home page - be creative, if you're in the mood, 
but don't spend hours on it :)

Finally, change your controller action from this:

```java
@GetMapping("/")
public String index() {
  return "Greetings from Spring Boot!";
}
```

...to this, which will now return a `ModelAndView`:

```java
@GetMapping("/")
public ModelAndView index() {
  return new ModelAndView("home");
}
```

remembering you'll need a new import at the top of the file for `ModelAndView`
too:

```java
import org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView;
```

Then restart your server and go back to `localhost:8080` to see your shiny new 
page.

> The `Model` part of `ModelAndView` will make more sense once you start 
> passing objects (models) through to your templates.

## Demonstration

## Exercise

Using your knowledge of how web applications work and your new knowledge of 
Java:

* Add a link to home.html so that when a user clicks on it they see another 
page called `links.html`.

[Example Solution](https://youtu.be/h29FjjVSasM)

## Challenge

* Add another route and page so that when a user navigates to "/quotes" they 
see some famous quotes (not an error message). You can choose your own 
favourite quotes.
