# Writing Java

_**This is a Makers Bite.** Bites are designed to train specific skills or
tools. They contain an intro, a demonstration video, some exercises with an
example solution video, and a challenge without a solution video for you to test
your learning. [Read more about how to use Makers
Bites.](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/labels/bites.md)_

In this bite, you will learn to build your first basic program in Java.

## Introduction

In this section, you'll learn how to build a minimal Java program. Let's start 
by looking at the Message program which you ran in the previous step.

```java
// we created a class called Message
class Message {
  // we added a slightly odd looking method called main
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // this line does the printing
    System.out.println("Hello? Is anyone out there?");
    // note that each line inside a method MUST end with a semi colon
  }
}
```

At this point, you probably have a few questions, including...

### Did we really need that class?

Yes, we did - all Java code must be encapsulated (contained) within a class. 
You can't just stick `System.out.println("Hello, World");` in a file on its own 
and (successfully) execute it.

### What is `public static void`?

Java method definitions often involve a few different keywords. Here we needed to use three:

* `public` - makes the method publicly accessible. This means it can be used 
from outside the Message class.

* `static` - static methods are methods where you don't need to create an 
instance of the class in order to call the method.

* `void` - this is where things get really interesting! Java is a _statically 
typed_ language, which means we must declare what _type_ of thing methods will 
return. Our `main` method doesn't return anything though, and we declare that 
by using the `void` keyword. If you were writing a method that would return a 
`String`, you'd use `String` instead of void. If the method was going to return 
an `Integer`, you'd use `Integer`... and so on.

### Is `String[] args` one argument or two?

This is one argument. As mentioned above, Java is _statically typed_. In 
addition to declaring what methods return, we also have to declare what they 
receive as arguments. In this case, we use `String[]` to declare that our `main` 
method will receive an array of `String`s. If it were going to receive a 
single `String`, we'd change `String[] args` to `String arg`.

<br>
<details>
<summary>How would we declare that the method would receive an array of 
<code>Integer</code>s?</summary>
We'd use <code>Integer[] args</code>.
</details>

### Does the filename have to match the class name?

Yes it does, and your code will not compile if they do not match.

### How does the `main` method get called?

If you pay close attention to the code above, you'll see that we just define 
the class and `main` method, but there is no place that we do anything like 
`Message.main()`. Clearly the `main` method does get called, because we see 
`Hello? Is there anyone out there?` printed.

The `main` method is a special method in Java programs that is called 
automatically when a program is executed. So, every Java program must have one, 
and only one, `main` method. If you your program has no `main` methods, it will 
not compile. If your program has more than one `main` method, it will not 
compile either!

> You can test this quite easily by renaming the `main` method to _anything_ 
else, and trying to run your code.

## Exercise

Create a new java class by right-clicking on the `examples` directory in 
IntelliJ and selecting `New -> Java Class`. You'll be prompted to choose a 
name; call it `JavaQuiz`. IntelliJ will then create a new file with the 
beginning of a class definition. It should look like this:

```java
package bites.examples;

public class JavaQuiz {
}
```

Without copy-pasting any code, write a `main` method and, in the method body, 
print out your answers to these questions:

> Don't forget those semi colons!

1. Does all Java code have to be inside a class?
2. What is compilation?
3. What is special about the main method?
4. What does `void` mean?

## Challenge

Create another Java class, called whatever you like, with a main method. 
Inside the main method print `args` and some messages that explain what's being 
printed. Your program should compile and execute without errors.
