# Arithmetic

_**This is a Makers Bite.** Bites are designed to train specific skills or
tools. They contain an intro, a demonstration video, some exercises with an
example solution video, and a challenge without a solution video for you to test
your learning. [Read more about how to use Makers
Bites.](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/labels/bites.md)_

In this bite, you will learn to do some maths with Java!

## Introduction

> If you hate maths, fear not - we're going to do pretty simple stuff here :)

Java makes things simple, as the common operators are exactly what you would 
probably expect them to be.

```java
// addition
1 + 1
// subtraction
10 - 1
// multiplication
10 * 10
// division
10 / 10
// modulo
10 % 2
```

## Demonstration

## Exercise

Define a class called `Order` which has one instance Integer field called 
`total` and three instance methods:

* addAmount -> takes one Integer and adds it to the total
* addDiscount -> takes one Integer and subtracts it from the total
* getTotal -> returns the total

Use all these methods in the `main` to build an order and print the total.

## Challenge

Define a class called `Discounter` which has one Integer field called 
`discount` and one instance method:

* applyTo -> takes an integer, subtracts the `discount` and returns the 
new value

For example:

```java
Discounter discounter = new Discounter(20);
discounter.applyTo(100)
// returns 80
discounter.applyTo(200)
// returns 180
```

Inside the `main` method, create an instance of `Discounter` use the `applyTo` 
method and print the return values. As an added challenge, print some strings 
before and after the discount to explain what's going on.

If you want to get even more advanced, try changing the behaviour of your
Discounter so that it applies a _percentage_ discount instead of a fixed 
amount.
